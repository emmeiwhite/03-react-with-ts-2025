# React with TypeScript

## Why TypeScript in the first place?

- Static type checking
- We get to learn about the potential bugs as we are typing (at development time)
- Provides a way to describe the shape of an object, hence providing better documentation and autocomplete
- Makes maintenance and refactoring of large code basis much easier.

## Typing Props

- Defining the structure of the props
